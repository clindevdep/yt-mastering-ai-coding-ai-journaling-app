# Project Name

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built using Vue.js and other modern web technologies. It provides a user interface for entering and managing data, with features including a home page, an about page, and a counter functionality.

## Core Technologies

- Vue.js 3: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- Vue Router: Official router for Vue.js applications
- Pinia: State management library for Vue.js
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the backend
- npm: Package manager for JavaScript

## Core Components and Their Relationships

1. **App.vue**: The main component that serves as the application shell.
2. **EntryForm.vue**: A component for user data input.
3. **Home.vue**: The home page view component.
4. **About.vue**: The about page view component.
5. **Router**: Manages navigation between different views.
6. **Pinia Store**: Handles state management across the application.

The `App.vue` component serves as the main container, while `Router` determines which view (`Home.vue` or `About.vue`) to display. The `EntryForm.vue` component is likely used within one of these views for data input. The Pinia store (in `stores/counter.js`) manages the application state that can be accessed by any component.

## Building and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the compiled and minified assets ready for deployment.

### Additional Commands

- Linting: `npm run lint`
- Running tests (if configured): `npm run test`
