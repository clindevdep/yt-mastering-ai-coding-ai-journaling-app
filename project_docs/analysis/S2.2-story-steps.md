# Story S2.2 Implementation Steps

## Step 1. Enable Basic Local Storage Integration
Must Support:
- Saving entries to localStorage
- Loading entries from localStorage
- Basic error handling for storage operations
Manual Verification:
- Entry data persists after page refresh
- Previously saved entries appear when reopening the app
- Basic error message appears if storage fails
Prerequisite: Entries store functionality
Developer Notes:
- Consider implementing storage operations as separate service
- Handle JSON serialization/deserialization
- Include basic error catching

## Step 2. Enable Automatic Synchronization
Must Support:
- Automatic saving when entries change
- Immediate storage updates
- Conflict resolution between memory and storage
Manual Verification:
- Changes are saved without manual intervention
- Data remains consistent between refreshes
- No data loss during normal operation
Prerequisite: Basic storage integration
Developer Notes:
- Consider debouncing frequent updates
- Maintain data consistency
- Handle concurrent modifications

## Step 3. Implement Storage Quota Management
Must Support:
- Available storage space checking
- Warning when approaching storage limits
- Prevention of saves when quota exceeded
Manual Verification:
- Warning appears when storage is nearly full
- Clear message when storage limit is reached
- Existing data remains intact when quota exceeded
Prerequisite: Automatic synchronization
Developer Notes:
- Calculate storage requirements
- Consider compression if needed
- Preserve existing data integrity

## Step 4. Add Save Operation Feedback
Must Support:
- Visual indicators for save progress
- Success confirmations
- Failure notifications
Manual Verification:
- User sees when saves are in progress
- Success message appears after save completes
- Error notification shows if save fails
Prerequisite: Storage quota management
Developer Notes:
- Keep feedback non-intrusive
- Ensure feedback is visible but not disruptive
- Consider temporary status indicators
