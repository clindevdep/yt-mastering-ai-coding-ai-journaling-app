# Initial User Stories for AI-Powered Brainstorming and Journaling App

## User Story 1: Set up Vue.js project with Vuetify

As a developer, I want to set up a new Vue.js 3.3.4 project with Vuetify 3.3.15 integration, so that I have a foundation for building the AI-powered brainstorming and journaling app.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a new Vue.js 3.3.4 project using Vue CLI or Vite
- Install and configure Vuetify 3.3.15
- Create a simple "Hello World" component using Vuetify
- Ensure the app runs without errors

## User Story 2: Implement basic routing and state management

As a developer, I want to set up Vue Router 4.2.4 and Pinia 2.1.6 in the project, so that I can handle navigation and manage application state.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Install and configure Vue Router 4.2.4
- Set up a basic route for the home page
- Install and configure Pinia 2.1.6
- Create a simple store to manage app state
- Demonstrate routing by creating a "Home" and an "About" page
- Show a simple state change (e.g., a counter) using Pinia

## User Story 3: Add form handling and HTTP client

As a developer, I want to integrate VeeValidate 4.11.6 for form handling and Axios 1.5.0 for HTTP requests, so that I can manage user input and prepare for future API interactions.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Install and configure VeeValidate 4.11.6
- Create a simple form with validation (e.g., a "Create Entry" form with a title field)
- Install Axios 1.5.0
- Demonstrate a basic Axios GET request to a placeholder API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder)
